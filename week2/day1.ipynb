       "1.  **Visualize the Books:** The two volumes are standing side by side in the usual order on a bookshelf. This means Volume 1 is on the left and Volume 2 is on the right.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Locate the Starting Point:** The worm starts at the **first page of Volume 1**. In a standard book, the first page is on the right side of the page block, right behind the front cover. Because Volume 1 is on the left, its front cover is facing Volume 2.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Locate the Ending Point:** The worm ends at the **last page of Volume 2**. The last page of a book is on the left side of the page block, just before the back cover. Because Volume 2 is on the right, its back cover is facing Volume 1.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Trace the Worm's Path:** The two volumes are touching. The front cover of Volume 1 is touching the back cover of Volume 2.\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   The worm starts at the first page of Volume 1.\n",
       "    *   It immediately gnaws through the **front cover of Volume 1** (2 mm).\n",
       "    *   It then immediately gnaws through the **back cover of Volume 2** (2 mm).\n",
       "    *   It has now reached the last page of Volume 2, so it stops.\n",
       "\n",
       "The worm does not go through the pages of either book. It only passes through the two covers that are between the start and end points.\n",

       "**Total distance = (Thickness of Vol. 1's front cover) + (Thickness of Vol. 2's back cover)**\n",
